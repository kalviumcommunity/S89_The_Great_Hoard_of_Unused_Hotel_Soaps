# The Great Hoard of Unused Hotel Soaps

## Project Overview
**The Great Hoard of Unused Hotel Soaps** is a user-generated collection tracking app for individuals who have taken hotel soaps but never used them. It adds a humorous touch to an oddly common habitâ€”hoarding free toiletries from hotels while traveling.

Users can log in to manage, categorize, and rank their mini soap collections, adding details such as hotel names, brands, and even photos. The app features a rarity scoring system, a leaderboard of extreme hoarders, and a soap swap feature to exchange rare soaps with fellow collectors.

## Why This Project?
I chose this project because it's **silly, fun, and surprisingly relatable**â€”who hasnâ€™t grabbed a free hotel soap at least once? While being absurdly entertaining, this project also provides valuable learning opportunities in:

- **Full-Stack Development** â€“ Integrating frontend and backend systems.
- **User Authentication & Database Management** â€“ Handling secure logins and data storage.
- **Dynamic User-Driven Applications** â€“ Allowing users to contribute and interact with content.
- **Ranking & Leaderboards** â€“ Implementing a competitive feature for engagement.

This project is both a **hilarious concept** and a **practical software development challenge**. Looking forward to building this quirky but functional app! ðŸ˜†
